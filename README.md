# MongoDB Interaction Interface using Zara Dataset

## Project Overview

This project aims to provide a Python interface for interacting with MongoDB, utilizing the Zara dataset.

## Key Features

- **Python Interface**: We've implemented a Python interface that offers a straightforward and user-friendly way to interact with MongoDB.

- **Data Preprocessing**: The `preprocessing.py` file is included to ensure that the Zara dataset is appropriately prepared for use with MongoDB.

- **CRUD Operations**: You can perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations within the MongoDB database using the `zara.py` file.

- **Image Handling**: Enhance the interface and improve data visualization by utilizing images from the `frame0` folder.

- **Project Presentation**: For a comprehensive understanding of the project, please refer to the PDF presentation file (`presentation.pdf`).
